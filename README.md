## What is Spooklementary?

* Spooklementary, by SpacEagle17, is an edit of EminGT's [Complementary Shaders](https://www.complementary.dev). It is a horror themed shaderpack and transforms your game into a moody and spooky experience. Perfect for Halloween or scary maps!

### Important notice: Please don't report any bugs while using this add-on to Emin, but to me instead on Discord.
